This cybersecurity project focuses on a deliberately insecure blog application designed to demonstrate common web vulnerabilities and their mitigation. The team identifies key issues such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and then provides patched versions of the code to fix these flaws. The project also includes detailed documentation of the vulnerabilities, example exploits, and the improved secure code implementationsâ€”and additionally documents successful penetration testing performed on another team's website to uncover and demonstrate similar vulnerabilities.
